            <h2>What is CSS?</h2>
            <p>
                Without CSS, HTML file has internal stylesheets with basic default styles to be 
                basically readable. With CSS, HTML file has text styling, layout, and animations.
            </p>
            <p>
                CSS rules start with selector, then curly braces, then declarations (which
                are property and value pairs separated by colons and ending with semicolons).
            </p>
        </article>
        <article id="getting-started-with-css">
            <h2>Getting Started with CSS</h2>
            <p>
                Linking to CSS doc from head of HTML doc (most useful/usual).
            </p>
            <p>
                To link CSS doc from head of HTML doc, use link element with rel and href 
                attributes. rel tells the browser that we have a stylesheet (rel="stylesheet")
                and href tells the browser the location of that stylesheet 
                (href="styles/styles.css").
            </p>
            <p>
                The selectors target an HTML element to apply the declarations to. There can be
                multiple selectors. To select specific elements, use the class attribute. To 
                target specific elements, start with period (.) and name of class 
                (e.g. class="special" -> .special {color: blue;}). To target specific subsets of 
                elements, start with element, period, and class name (e.g. li.special {} to target
                li elements that have a class of special). It is sometimes best to bypass element 
                and refer to class.
            </p>
            <p>
                To target something based on where it is in the document, put the elements separated
                by a space in the selector (e.g. li em {} to target any em element inside an li 
                element). AKA descendant combinator.
            </p>
            <p>
                To target an adjacent element, put the elements with a + in between them (e.g. 
                h1 + p {} to target the p directly after an h1).
            </p>
            <p>
                To target things based on their state, put the element, a colon, and the state of
                interest (e.g. a:link {} to target anchor elements when they're unvisited).
            </p>
            <p>
                You can combine multiple types when targeting (e.g. body h1 + p .special {} to 
                target any element with a class of special, which is inside a p, which comes just
                after an h1, which is inside a body.)

            <h2>How CSS is Structured</h2>
            <p>
                There are three different ways to apply CSS to an HTML doc:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>With an external stylesheet</li>
                <li>With an internal stylesheet</li>
                <li>With inline styles</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Using external stylesheet: link to CSS file using link rel href. Most useful, and
                most common.
            </p>
            <p>
                Using internal stylesheet: place CSS inside style element contained inside head 
                element. Can be useful in some circumstances, but not for sites with more than 
                one page.
            </p>
            <p>
                Using inline styles: place CSS declarations within a style attribute for a single 
                HTML element. Can be useful in few circumstances, but best to avoid using CSS in 
                this way. 
            </p>
            <p>
                The CSS language has rules to control which selector is stronger in the event of a
                conflict. These rules are called cascade and specificity.
            </p>
            <p>
                Cascade rule: later styles replace conflicting styles that appear earlier in the 
                stylesheet.
            </p>
            <p>
                Specificity rule: the thing with more specificity is applied over other later styles.
            </p>
            <p>
                A CSS declaration is made up of a property and value. A CSS declaration block is made 
                up of many declarations. CSS declaration blocks are paired with selectors to produce 
                CSS rules. Setting CSS properties to specific values is the primary way of defining 
                layout and styling for a document.
            </p>
            <p>
                Some values can take the form of a function. Examples: The calc() function can do 
                simple math within CSS. The transform function can change the element with various 
                values within transform, e.g. rotate. 
            </p>
            <p>
                CSS @rules provide instruction for what CSS should perform or how it should behave.
                A common one is @media, which use conditional logic for applying CSS styling.
            </p>
            <p>
                Shorthand properties set several values in a given line. Reduces the lines of code 
                needed. e.g. padding: 1 2 3 4 is shorthand for padding-top: 1; padding-right:2; 
                padding-bottom: 3; padding-left: 4;. Properties like font, background, border, and 
                margin can also do this.
            </p>
            <p>
                WARNING: a value not specified in CSS shorthand reverts to initial value. This means
                an omission in CSS shorthand can override previously set values.
            </p>
            <p> 
                To write CSS comments, /* words */.  A good way to use comments is to mark the start 
                of distinct sections of code, so searching for comments in code editors becomes a way 
                to efficiently find a section of code.
            </p>
            <p>
                As with HTML, CSS has white space to improve readability.

            <h2>How CSS Works</h2>
            <p>
                The following is (roughly) what happens when browser loads webpage:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>browser loads HTML</li>
                <li>browser converts HTML into DOM (document object model), which represents the 
                    document in the computer's memory.</li>
                <li>browser fetches resources linked to by HTML (including CSS), JavaScript later but 
                    is out of scope atm.</li>
                <li>browser parses CSS, sorts rules by selector types into "buckets", attaches style 
                    to nodes in DOM by selector (render tree).</li>
                <li>render tree laid out how it should appear after rules applied</li>
                <li>visual display of page shown on screen (painting)</li>
            </ol>
            <p>
                A DOM has a tree-like structure. Each element, attribute, and piece of text in the 
                markup language becomes a DOM node in the tree structure. The nodes are defined by 
                their relationship to other DOM nodes. Some elements are parents of child nodes, 
                and child nodes have siblings.
            </p>
            <p>
                Understanding the DOM helps you design, debug and maintain your CSS because the DOM 
                is where your CSS and the document's content meet up. When you start working with 
                browser DevTools you will be navigating the DOM as you select items in order to see 
                which rules apply.
            </p>
            <p>
                If browser encounters CSS it doesn't understand, either because it's older or feature 
                is new, it ignores it. Allows for fallback styling, including two declarations, one 
                for older and one for newer.
            </p>
            <p>

        </article>
        <article id="cascade-and-inheritance">
            <h2>Cascade and Inheritance</h2>
            <p>
                Inheritance means that //some// CSS properties by default inherit values set on the 
                current element's parent element, and //some// don't.
            </p>
            <p>
                For example, applying color to p element will apply that color to all p, except for 
                a span element within a p if the span element has another color applied to it.
            </p>
            <p>
                Things like widths, margins, padding, and borders do not inherit. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Four special universal property values for controlling inheritance:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>inherit -- sets property value applied to selected element to be the same as 
                    that of its parent element (turns on inheritance)</li>
                <li>initial -- sets property value applied to selected element to initial value 
                    of that property</li>
                <li>unset -- resets property to natural value (if property is naturally inherited, 
                    it acts like inherit, otherwise like initial)</li>
                <li>revert -- acts like unset in many cases, however will revert the property to 
                    browser's default styling rather than defaults applied to that property</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                To apply one of the inheritance values to (almost) all properties at once: use CSS 
                shorthand property all. It's a convenient way to undo changes made to styles so that
                you can get back to a known starting point before beginning new changes.
            </p>
            <p>
                Three factors when understanding the cascade, in increasing order of importance:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>Source Order</li>
                <li>Specificity</li>
                <li>Importance</li>
            </ol>
            <p>
                Source order is when the later rule will win over earlier rule.
            </p>
            <p>
                Specificity is when an element is more specific than another, and therefore is being 
                chosen by the browser as the one that should style the element. Note that although we
                are thinking about selectors and the rules that are applied to the thing they select,
                it isn't the entire rule which is overruled, only the properties which are the same.
                This helps avoid repetition.
            </p>
            <p>
                It's common to define generic styles for the basic elements, and then create classes 
                for those which are different.
            </p>
            <p>
                The amount of specificity a selector has is measured using four different values (or 
                components):
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>thousands -- if declaration inside style attribute</li>
                <li>hundreds -- for each ID selector contained inside overall selector</li>
                <li>tens -- for each class selector, attribute selector, or pseudo-class contained 
                    inside overall selector</li>
                <li>ones -- for each element selector or pseudo-element contained inside overall 
                    selector</li>
            </ol>
            <p>
                Note that *, +, >, ~, '', and :not have no effect on specificity.
            </p>
            <p>
                There are levels to specificity, but only really relevant in ties.
            </p>
            <p>
                You can use !important to override all specificity calculations, but is strongly 
                recommended to never use it unless you absolutely have to, since it can make 
                debugging CSS problems really hard to work out.
            </p>
            <p>
                It is possible for users to set custom stylesheets to override the developer's styles.
            </p>

        <article id="css-selectors">
            <h2>CSS Selectors</h2>
            <p>
                Use # to target an ID. Use a[title] to select elements based on the presence of a certain
                attribute on an element, or an attribute with a particular value.
            </p>
            <p>
                Pseudo-classes style certain states of an element. Pseudo-elements style a certain part of
                an element rather than the element itself. Pseudo-classes: a:hover {}. Pseudo-element: 
                p::first-line {}. Combinators combine other selectors in order to target elements.
            </p>

                To see a reference table of selectors (scroll to the bottom): 
                <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Building_blocks/Selectors">Reference Table of Selectors</a>
            </p>
            <h3>Type, Class, and ID Selectors</h3>
            <p>
                Type selector (AKA tag name selector, element selector) selects an HTML tag/element 
                in your document.
            </p>
            <p>
                Universal selector (indicated by askerisk (*) ) selects everything in the document (or 
                inside the parent element if it is being chained together with another element and a 
                descendant combinator). Since the universal selector makes global changes, we use it 
                for very specific situations, like in "reset stylesheets", which strip out all of the 
                browser styling.
            </p>
            <p>
                One use of the universal selector is to make selectors easier to read and more obvious
                in terms of what they're doing. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Be aware of spacing when using pseudo-classes and pseudo-elements. e.g. article:first-child
                and article :first child are targeting two different things. Use the universal selector on
                the latter to make it more obvious what the selector is doing.
            </p>
            <p>
                Class selector (indicated by dot (.) ) select everything in the document with that class
                applied to it.
            </p>
            <p>
                You can also create a selector that'll target specific elements with the class applied.
                This approach reduces the scope of a rule. The rule will only apply to that particular
                element and class combination. You'd need to add another selector if you decided the rule 
                should apply to other elements too.
            </p>
            <p>
                You can apply multiple classes to an element and target them individually, or only select 
                the element when all of the classes in the selector are present. This can be helpful when 
                building up components that can be combined in different ways on your site. e.g. when a box 
                has an class of notebox, but needs another class of warning or danger to change the 
                border-color.
            </p>
            <p>
                ID selectors (indicated by hash (#) ) are used in the same way as a class selector. However, 
                an ID can be used only once per page, and elements can only have a single id value applied 
                to them. It can select an element that has the id set on it, and you can precede the ID with 
                a type selector to only target the element if both the element and ID match.
            </p>
            <p>
                In most cases, it's preferable to add a class to an element instead of an ID.
            </p>
            <h3>Attribute Selectors</h3>
            <p>
                Presence and value selectors enable the selection of an element based on the presence of an 
                attribute alone, or on various diff matches against the value of the attribute.
            </p>
            <p>
                Here are the four presence and value selectors:
            </p>
            <table>
                <thead>
                    <th>Selector</th>
                    <th>Description</th>
                </thead>
                <tbody>
                    <tr>
                        <td>[attr]</td>
                        <td>Matches elements w attr</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>[attr=value]</td>
                        <td>Matches elements w attr whose value is exactly value</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>[attr~=value]</td>
                        <td>Matches elements w attr whose value is exactly value,
                            or contains value in its (space separated) list of values.</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>[attr|=value]</td>
                        <td>Matches elements w attr whose value is exactly value, 
                            or begins w value immediately followed by hyphen.</td>
                    </tr>
                </tbody>
            </table>
            <p>
                Substring matching selectors allow for more advanced matching of substrings inside the value
                of your attribute. Here are the three substring matching selectors:
            </p>
            <table>
                <thead>
                    <th>Selector</th>
                    <th>Description</th>
                </thead>
                <tbody>
                    <tr>
                        <td>[attr^=value]</td>
                        <td>Matches elements w attr, whose value BEGINS with value.</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>[attr$=value]</td>
                        <td>Matches elements w attr, whose value ENDS with value.</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>[attr*=value]</td>
                        <td>Matches elements w attr, whose value contains value anywhere 
                            in the string.</td>
                    </tr>
                </tbody>
            </table>
            <p>
                To match attribute values case-insensitively, use value i before closing bracket. e.g. 
                [attr=value i]. 
            </p>
            <h3>Pseudo-classes and Pseudo-elements</h3>
            <p>
                A pseudo-class is a selector that selects elements that are in a specific state. They tend to
                act as if you had applied a class to some part of your document. To create a pseudo-class,
                :pseudo-class-name.
            </p>
            <p>
                Some examples of pseudo-classes: :first-child, :last-child, :only-child, :invalid. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Some pseudo-classes only apply when the user interacts with the document in some way. AKA 
                user-action pseudo-classes, dynamic pseudo-classes. They act as if a class had been added 
                to the element when the user interacts with it.
            </p>
            <p>
                Pseudo-elements behave in a similar way, but as if you had added a whole new HTML element 
                into the markup, rather than applying a class to existing documents. To create a pseudo-element:
                ::pseudo-element-name.
            </p>
            <p>
                You can combine both pseudos here to be even more specific.
            </p>
            <p>
                You can use ::before and ::after with the content property to insert content before or after 
                some other piece of content. This can be text, but more valid to insert icons. This is referred
                to as "Generated Content" in CSS. Can add "" to content and style that as an image of sorts. 
            </p>
            <p>

            <h3>Combinators</h3>
            <p>
                Descendant combinator (typ represented by single space ( ) character) combine two selectors 
                such that elements matched by the second selector are selected if they have an ancestor element
                matching the first selector. Selectors that utilize a descendant combinator are called descendant
                selectors. e.g. .box p {} matches only p element which is inside an element with a class of 
                .box. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Child combinator (>) is placed between two CSS selectors and matches only those elements matched by 
                the second selector that are the direct children of elements matched by the first. Descendent elements 
                further down the hierarchy don't match. e.g. article > p matches only p elements that are direct 
                children of article elements. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Adjacent sibling combinator (+) is placed between two CSS selectors and matches only those elements 
                matched by the second selector that are the next sibling element of the first selector. e.g. p + img 
                selects all img elements that are immediately preceded by a p element. It's common to do something 
                with a paragraph that follows a heading.
            </p>
            <p>
                General sibling combinator (~) is placed between two CSS selectors and matches siblings of an element 
                even if they are not directly adjacent. e.g. p ~ img selects all img elements that come anywhere after 
                p elements.
            </p>
            <p>
                You can combine ANY of the selectors discussed in order to pick out part of your document. However, 
                creating big lists of selectors that select very specific parts of the doc makes it hard to reuse those 
                CSS rules. Often better to create simple class and apply that to element in question. Knowledge of 
                combinators useful if unable to access HTML.

            <h2>The Box Model</h2>
            <p>
                Two types of boxes in CSS: block boxes and inline boxes. Boxes also have an inner display type and 
                an outer display type.
            </p>
            <p>
                Outer display type block behavior:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>break into new line</li>
                <li>extend in inline direction to fill space avail in container. in most cases this means box becomes 
                    as wide as container, filling up 100% of avail space</li>
                <li>width and height properties respected</li>
                <li>padding, margin, and border cause other elements to be pushed away from box</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Outer display type inline behavior:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>won't break into new line</li>
                <li>width and height properties won't apply</li>
                <li>vertical padding, margins, and borders will apply but WON'T cause other inline boxes to move 
                    away from box</li>
                <li>horizontal padding, margins, and borders will apply and WILL cause other inline boxes to move 
                    away from box</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Inner display type dictates how elements inside box are laid out. Laid out in normal flow by default,
                where they behave just like any other block and inline elements.
            </p>
            <p>
                KEY: Changing the value of the display property can change whether the outer display type of a box is 
                block or inline, which changes the way it displays alongside other elements in the layout.
            </p>
            <p>
                Four parts to a block box in CSS, from inner to outer parts:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>content box</li>
                <li>padding box</li>
                <li>border box</li>
                <li>margin box</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                The standard CSS box model: giving box width and height attr => content box. Any padding and border 
                is added to that width and height to get total size taken up by box. Default.
            </p>
            <p>
                The alternative CSS box model: given box width and height attr => content + padding + border. Content 
                width is given width minus width of padding and border. More convenient than standard. To set, give 
                the element a property of box-sizing: border-box . To set document-wide, add property on html element, then
                set all other elements to inherit that value through universal selector (*), *::before, and *::after with 
                property of boxing-size: inherit. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Can use browser's DevTools to view the box models on websites.
            </p>
            <p>
                Margin is invisible space around box that pushes other elements away from (or overlaps with) box, depending
                on if the margin value is positive or negative. Longhand: margin-top, margin-right, margin-bottom, margin-left. 
                Shorthand: margin a b c d. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Margin collapsing is where if you have two elements whose margins touch, three things can happen:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>both margins positive, combine into one and size is equal to largest indiv margin</li>
                <li>one margin negative, value is subtracted from total</li>
                <li>both margins negative, both collapse and smallest (furthest from 0) value will be used</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                For more on margin collapsing, as it's out of scope atm:

            </p>
            <p>
                Border can be styled (all 12) via width, style, and color. And via top, right, bottom, or left.
                In those orders and combinations. border top width style color right width style color... 
            </p>
            <p>
                Padding cannot be negative. Typically used to push content away from border. Any background applied to element
                will display behind the padding. Can be styled via top, right, bottom, left.
            </p>
            <p>
                Above applies to block boxes as well.
            </p>
            <p>
                An element with display: inline-block does not break into a new line, and will only become larger than its 
                content if you explicitly add width and height properties. Useful when you want to give a link a larger hit
                area by adding padding, like with navigation bars with big buttons instead of links.

        <article id="backgrounds-and-borders">
            <h2>Backgrounds and Borders</h2>
            <p>
                Background property has many, MANY longhand properties. Border property is VERY customizable.
            </p>
            <p>
                background-color property defines background color on any element in CSS. It accepts any valid color. 
                It extends underneath the content and padding box of element.
            </p>
            <p>
                background-image property enables display of image in background of element. 
            </p>
            <p>
                background-repeat property controls tiling behavior of images. There are four values:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>no-repeat: stops background from repeating</li>
                <li>repeat-x: repeat horiz</li>
                <li>repeat-y: repeat vert</li>
                <li>repeat: default, in both dir</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                background-size property controls image size. Can take length or percentage values, or keywords 
                cover (completely covers box area, some outside box) and contain (fits inside box area, some gaps).
            </p>
            <p>
                background-position property allows you to choose position in which background image appears on box 
                it's applied to. Uses coord system (x,y), with default (0,0). Can use keywords, lengths, percentages,
                combinations of these, or 4-value syntax. Keywords: top, bottom, left, right, center.
            </p>
            <p>
                A gradient (when used for background) acts just like image and is also set by using background-image. 
                Can use online gradient generators to generate gradient, and then copy/paste source code. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Can have multiple background images, and specify multiple values in single property value, which apply 
                in a certain order when cycled. Useful to use background rgba, with 0 0 0 0.5 (last one for opacity),
                for semi-transparent background.
            </p>
            <p>
                background-attachment specifies how they scroll when content scrolls. There are three values:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>scroll: background scrolls when content scrolls</li>
                <li>fixed: background is fixed</li>
                <li>local: background scrolls along with element</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                To write background with shorthand, there are a few rules: 
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>background-color specified AFTER final comma</li>
                <li>background-size included immediately after background-position, separated with "/" char</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Can use borders creatively, since customizability so wide.
            </p>

                border-radius allows us to have rounded corners on a box. Two lengths or percentages. First value is 
                horiz radius, second value is vert radius. In many cases, only pass one value, used for both. To 
                specify a corner, border-top/bottom-left/right-radius.

            <h2>Handling Different Text Directions</h2>
            <p>
                AKA writing modes. Use the writing-mode property. Three possible values:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>horizontal-tb: top->bottom horiz</li>
                <li>vertical-rl: right->left vert</li>
                <li>vertical-lr: left->right vert</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Two dimensions: block dimension, which is the direction blocks are displayed on the page in the writing
                mode in sue, and inline dimesion, which is the direction a sentence flows.
            </p>
            <p>
                With regards to direction: newer CSS layouts don't refer to lr-tb, but to start and end. 
            </p>
            <p>
                To prevent text overflow in diff writing modes, CSS has mapped properties, which replace physical 
                properties (like width and height) with logical, or flow relative versions (like inline-size and 
                block-size).
            </p>
            <p>
                Many physical properties have been replaced with these logical, flow relative versions. For more on 
                this: 
                <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Logical_Properties" >CSS Logical Properties</a>
            </p>
            <p>
                There are also logical values, which replace physical values like top, right, bottom, and left, with 
                logical values like block-start, inline-end, block-end, and inline-start.
            </p>
            <p>
                Should you use physical or logical properties? Most will transition to logical versions eventually, 
                makes more sense when dealing with layout methods such as flexbox and grid.

        <article id="overflowing-content">
            <h2>Overflowing Content</h2>
            <p>
                Overflow is what happens when there's too much content to fit in a container. Overflow content not hidden 
                because that'd cause data loss. 
            </p>
            <p>
                The overflow property allows you to take control of an element's overflow. Default is visible. Use hidden only 
                if it won't cause problems. Use scroll to always display a scrollbar. Use auto to display a scrollbar only when 
                overflow occurs.
            </p>
            <p>
                When overflow property used, you create a Block Formatting Context (BFC), where the context of the box acquires 
                a self-contained layout (nothing pokes in, nothing can poke out). Enables consistent scrolling behavior.
            </p>
            <p>
                When developing a site, always keep overflow in mind. Test designs with large/small amounts of text, font sizes, 
                etc. Changing overflow value or scrollbars reserved for a select few cases.

            <h2>Values and Units</h2>
            <p>
                A value type in CSS is a way to define a collection of allowable values.
            </p>
            <p>
                Here's a list of absolute length units (more useful when used for print, rather than 
                screen output):
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>cm, for centimeters</li>
                <li>mm, for millimeters</li>
                <li>Q, for quarter-millimeters</li>
                <li>in, for inches</li>
                <li>pc, for picas</li>
                <li>pt, for points</li>
                <li>px, for pixels</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Here's a list of most useful relative length units (useful if you want elements to scale relative to everything else 
                on the page):
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>em, relative to font size of parent and element itself</li>
                <li>ex, relative to x-height of element's font</li>
                <li>ch, relative to advance measure (width) of glyph "0" of element's font</li>
                <li>rem, relative to font size of root element</li>
                <li>lh, relative to line height of element</li>
                <li>vw, relative to 1% of viewport's width</li>
                <li>vh, relative to 1% of viewport's height</li>
                <li>vmin, relative to 1% of viewport's smaller dimension</li>
                <li>vmax, relative to 1% of viewport's larger dimension</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                em and rem are the most likely relative lengths dealt with when sizing anything from boxes to text. Important to know 
                how both work, and how they're different. em often leads to progressively larger sizes, rem does not.
            </p>
            <p>
                Percentages are always set relative to some other value, often of the parent. Similar to em in that it can lead to 
                progressively smaller (or larger) sizes. Not all value types accept percentages. Percentages resolve against the size 
                of the containing block.
            </p>
            <p>
                Some value types can accept numbers w/o any unit on them, like the opacity property (between 0 and 1).
            </p>
            <p>
                Some colors have keywords (e.g. blue instead of #0000FF). Other colors have hexadecimal codes, starting with # with 6 
                hexadecimal numbers, which can be 0123456789abcdef. More complex, but more versatile (good for color schemes, etc).
            </p>
            <p>
                Still more colors use RBG, with rbg(), with parameters red, green, and blue channel values, consisting of decimal
                numbers between 0 and 255. A fourth value is sometimes addedd, rbga(), controlling opacity, between 0 and 1.
            </p>
            <p>
                There's also HSL color model, accepting hue (0-360), saturation (%), and lightness values (%). Designers prefer this.
            </p>
            <p>
                Image value types can take actual image files via url(), or gradient. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Position value types can take two values, horizontal and vertical position. Can take keywords top, left (vert posn) 
                and bottom, right (horiz posn).
            </p>
            <p>
                Keywords more accurately described as identifiers, a special value that CSS understands. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Function values are useful if you want to work out values that you can't define when writing the CSS, and need
                the browser to work it out for you at runtime.

        <article id="sizing-items-in-css">
            <h2>Sizing Items in CSS</h2>
            <p> 
                HTML elements have a natural size, set before they're affected by CSS. When a size is given to an element in CSS,
                it's referred to as an extrinsic size. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Due to the problem of overflow, fixing the height of elements with lengths or percentages is something we need to 
                do very carefully on the web.
            </p>
            <p>
                When using margin and padding set in percentages, the value is calculated from the inline size of the containing
                block. This means you can have equal-sized margins and padding all around the box. This is a fact worth 
                remembering if you do use percentages in this way.
            </p>
            <p>
                You can also give an element a minimum or a maximum size. min-height ensures element will always be at least this 
                height, but will then grow taller if there's more content than the box has space for at its minimum height. Very 
                useful for dealing with variable amounts of content while avoiding overflow. max-width useful to cause images to 
                scale down if not enough space to display them at intrinsic width while making sure they don't become larger than 
                that width.
            </p>
            <p>
                This technique is used to make images //responsive//, so that when viewed on a smaller device, they scale down 
                appropriately. However, images should be appropriately sized to be no larger than they need to be. 
            </p>
            <p>
                You can use viewport units to size something relative to the viewport of the user.

            <h2>Images, Media, and Form Elements</h2>
            <p>
                Replaced elements are those where CSS can't affect their internal layout, only their position amongst other 
                elements. Images and videos are replaced elements.
            </p>
            <p>
                Some replaced elements have an aspect ratio, where it has a size in both horiz (x) and vert (y) dimensions, 
                and will be displayed using the intrinsic dimensions of the file by default.
            </p>
            <p>
                Common to handle overflow of images by making the max-width of an image 100%. Also works with video and iframe. 
            </p>
            <p>
                If you want to size an image so it completely covers a box, can use object-fit property. Three diff values:
                cover, sizes image down while maintaining aspect ratio, but some parts of image cropped by box; contain, 
                scales image down until small enough to fit in box, results in "letterboxing"; and fill, which fill box but 
                doesn't maintain aspect ratio.
            </p>
            <p>
                In a flex or grid layout, elements stretched by default to fill entire area. Images will not stretch, and 
                instead will be aligned to the start of the grid area or flex container.
            </p>
            <p>
                KEY: Keep in mind that replaced elements, when they become part of a grid or flex layout, have diff default 
                behaviors. essentially to avoid them being stretched strangely by the layout.
            </p>

                Forms added to webpage via input element. Defines simple form fields. The textarea element defines multiline 
                text input. And fieldset and legend elements contain and label parts of forms. HTML5 has attributes that 
                enable devs to indicate which fields are reqd, and even the type of content that needs to be entered. Out of 
                scope, more on Web Forms module of Mozilla pathway.

            <p>
                Dealing with form elements in HTML:

            <p>

            </p>
            <p>
                You should always assume forms are going to look diff for diff visitors, so test complex forms in a number of
                browsers.
            </p>
            <p>
                Some browsers don't inherit font styling by default. If you want it to, add inherit value to font-family. 
            </p>
            <p>
                When styling forms, best to set padding and margin to 0 at first, then add them back in when styling particular 
                controls. Should also set overflow: auto in textarea.

            <h2>Styling Tables</h2>
            <p>
                First, sort out the spacing/layout, as default is very cramped. 
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    table-layout: fixed; under table element. Generally a good idea to set, as it sets the column sizes
                    according to the width of their headings. Select the th elements individually (using nth-child) and 
                    give them set percentage widths. Give table element width of 100% to fill any container it's put in,
                    and be nicely responsive.
                </li>
                <li>
                    border-collapse: collapse; under table element. Default gives spacing between borders, doesn't look 
                    nice. Collapse value brings them together.
                </li>
                <li>
                    border under table element, any. Separate borders for table header and footer, so best to give table 
                    itself borders as well.
                </li>
                <li>
                    padding under th and td element, any. Makes data more legible, less cramped.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Next, we can add some simple typography (read: fonts). Nothing specific to tables here, more to do with 
                font styling.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    set a global (read: under html element) font stack, with custom fonts on certain table elements, if 
                    you wish. 
                </li>
                <li>
                    optional letter-spacing for better readability. 
                </li>
                <li>
                    text-align: center; under tbody, to line up with headings. Other text-align for aesthetic purposes. 
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Next, add some graphics and colors if you wish. Nothing specific to tables.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    You can add background-image to thead and tfood elements. (always make sure text contrasts well with 
                    background)
                </li>
                <li>
                    You can add linear gradient to th and td elements inside header and footer (or others) for nicer
                    texture.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Popular to implement zebra stripes, alternating rows of colors that make diff data rows in table 
                    easier to parse and read. Use nth-child(odd/even) to set the alternating colors. The odd/even can
                    be replaced with a formula (!).
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Last thing's to style the caption. Can use caption-side property to position caption around the table.
            </p>
            <p>
                Quick tips, to recap:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Make your table markup as simple as possible, and keep things flexible, e.g. by using percentages, so the design is more responsive.</li>
                <li>Use table-layout: fixed to create a more predictable table layout that allows you to easily set column widths by setting width on their headings (< th >).</li>
                <li>Use border-collapse: collapse to make table elements borders collapse into each other, producing a neater and easier to control look.</li>
                <li>Use < thead >, < tbody >, and < tfoot > to break up your table into logical chunks and provide extra places to apply CSS to, so it is easier to layer styles on top of one another if required.</li>
                <li>Use zebra striping to make alternative rows easier to read.</li>
                <li>Use text-align to line up your < th > and < td > text, to make things neater and easier to follow.</li>

                <li>Is something else overriding your CSS?</li>
                <li>Make a reduced test case of the problem</li>
            </ol>
            <p>
                For 1: basically, take a break. Think of something else. For 2: put the HTML and CSS through a validator
                to pick up and fix any errors. For 3: self-explanatory. For 4: specificity! DevTools! For 5: 
                "reduce an issue" by demonstrating the problem in the simplest way possible, with unrelated surrounding 
                content and styling removed. Shows you really tried to solve problem, and makes it easier to ask for help.

            <h2>Organizing your CSS</h2>
            <p>
                Best practices for writing CSS to make it easily maintainable: 
            </p>
            <p>
                Does your project have a coding style guide? The team style guide should always win over your own 
                personal preferences.
            </p>
            <p>
                Keep it consistent. Having a set of rules you always follow reduces the amount of mental overhead needed
                when writing CSS, as some of the decisions are already made. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Comment your CSS. Good tip to add block of comments between logical sections in your stylesheet, to help 
                locate diff sections quickly when scanning it. Can also comment on things where you made a particular 
                decision for a reason.
            </p>
            <p>
                Create logical sections in your stylesheet. Good idea to have all the common styling first, meaning all the 
                styles which will generally apply unless you do something special with that element. GENERAL STYLES, UTILITIES,
                SITEWIDE, and others based on context, page, or component.
            </p>
            <p>
                Avoid overly-specific selectors. There will be times when making something more specific makes sense; however, 
                this will generally be an exception rather than usual practice.
            </p>
            <p>
                Break large stylesheets into multiple smaller ones.
            </p>
            <p>
                These methodologies are essentially CSS coding guides that take a very structured approach to writing and 
                organizing CSS. Typically they tend to render CSS more verbosely than you might have if you wrote and 
                optimised every selector to a custom set of rules for that project.
            </p>
            <p>
                However, you do gain a lot of structure by adopting one. Since many of these systems are widely used, other 
                developers are more likely to understand the approach you are using and be able to write their own CSS in 
                the same way, rather than having to work out your own personal methodology from scratch.
            </p>
            <p>
                Most approaches stem from concept of Object Oriented CSS (OOCSS). There's also Block Element Modifier 
                (BEM). Others like SMACSS, ITCSS, ACSS. Disadvantage is that they can seem overly complex, especially 
                for smaller projects.
            </p>
            <p>
                Another way to organize CSS is to build systems for it. e.g. pre-processors and post-processors, most 
                popular pre-processor is Sass. Out of scope atm.

            <h2>Fundamental Text and Font Styling</h2>
            <p>
                Two CSS property categories used to style text:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>font styles</li>
                <li>text layout styles</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Properties for styling fonts: 
            </p>
            <p>
                color (self-explanatory)
            </p>
            <p>
                font-family. Web safe fonts are available nearly everywhere. Five generic default names for fonts: 
                serif, sans-serif, monospace, cursive, fantasy. Font stacks so that browser has multiple fonts it can 
                choose from. 
            </p>
            <p>
                font-size. Most common units px, em, rem. Standard in root element (html) is 16px, others have diff size.
                Best to use rem unit whe nyou can, to keep things simple. Avoid setting the font-size of container elements 
                where possible.
            </p>
            <p>
                Four common properties to alter visual weight/emphasis of text:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    font-style (normal, italic, or oblique values)
                </li>
                <li>
                    font-weight (normal, bold) (lighter, bolder) (100-900)
                </li>
                <li>
                    text-transform (none, uppercase, lowercase, capitalize, full-width)
                </li>
                <li>
                    text-decoration (none, underline, overline, line-through)
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                text-shadow: horizontal offset (px), vertical offset (px), blur radius, base shadow color. Can apply multiple
                shadows to the same text, separate via comma.
            </p>
            <p>
                Properties to affect text-layout:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    text-align (left, right, center, justify)
                </li>
                <li>
                    line-height (can take unitless value, acts as multiplier, considered best option. recommended 
                    1.5-2, double spaced.) 
                </li>
                <li>
                    letter-spacing and word-spacing (not used often)
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Others to explore once familiarized with the above:
            </p>
            <p>
                Font styles: font-variable, font-kerning, font-feature-settings, font-variant-alternates, font-variant-caps,
                font-variant-east-asian, font-variant-ligatures, font-variant-numeric, font-variant-position, font-size-adjust,
                font-stretch, text-underline-position, text-rendering.
            </p>
            <p>
                Text layout styles: text-indent, text-overflow, white-space, word-break, direction, hyphens, line-break, 
                text-align-last, text-orientation, overflow-wrap, writing-mode. 
            </p>
            <p>
                font shorthand: order is font-style, font-variant, font-weight, font-stretch, font-size, line-height, and 
                font-family. Add (/) between font-size and line-height properties.

        <article id="styling-lists">
            <h2>Styling Lists</h2>
            <p>
                Handling list spacing: need to adjust stypes so they keep same vertical spacing as surrounding environments, 
                and the same horizontal spacing as each other. Setting font size on HTML, relative sizes to h2 and list/p
                elements...
            </p>
            <p>
                Should know three list-specific properties to start:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    list-style-type = sets types of bullets (many types)
                </li>
                <li>
                    list-style-position = sets whether bullets inside or outside lists (default outside)
                </li>
                <li>
                    list-style-image = custom image for bullet
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                The three above can be set up using list-style shorthand, type image position. 
            </p>
            <p>
                start attribute for ol can start list count on number other than 1. reversed attribute will start list counting
                down instead of up. value attribute sets list items to specific numerical values.

            <h2>Styling Links</h2>

            <ul>
                <li>link (default underline)</li>

                Default styles have been around a LONG time, so don't stray too far from expected behaviors. You should at least
                use underline for links only, and make them react in some way when hovered/focused, and in slighly diff way when 
                activated.

            </p>
            <p>
                Common to include icons on links to provide more of an indicator as to what kind of content the link points to. 
                Use a[href*="#"] { } with properties background, background-size, and padding-right (or left).

            </p>
            <p>
                You can use font stack (with preferred, web-safe, and default fonts), but requires more testing to ensure it works. 
                CSS allows you to specify font files, available on the web, to be downloaded along with your website as it's accessed. 
                This means that any browser supporting this CSS feature can display the fonts you've specifically chosen. 
            </p>
            <p>
                At start of CSS, have @font-face rule. @font-face { font-family: "myFontName"; src: url("myFontName.woff2"); } Use myFontName 
                (whatever you named it) to apply custom font to anything you like.

                Finding fonts, generating required code, implementing code. Kind of boring, skip for now. You can use online font 
                services like Google Fonts (free!) and add code to HTML and CSS files.

        <article id="intro-to-css-layout">
            <h2>Intro to CSS Layout</h2>
            <p>
                CSS page layout techniques allow us to take elements contained in a web page and control where they're positioned relative to the 
                following factors: their default position in normal layout flow, the other elements around them, their parent container, and the 
                main viewport/window.
            </p>
            <p>
                List of page layout techniques covered here:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>normal flow</li>
                <li>display property</li>
                <li>flexbox</li>
                <li>grid</li>
                <li>floats</li>
                <li>positioning</li>
                <li>table layout</li>
                <li>multipe-column layout</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Normal flow is how browser lays out HTML pages by default when you do nothing to control page layout.
            </p>
            <p>
                Main methods for achieveing page layout in CSS all involve specifying values for the display property. Since you can change the value 
                of display for any element, you can pick HTML elements for their semantic meaning without being concerned about how they look. The way 
                they look is something you can change.
            </p>
            <p>
                display:block breaks into a new line. display:inline doesn't break into new line (side by side).
            </p>
            <p>
                Flexbox (aka Flexible Box Layout) is designed to make it easy to lay things out in one dimension, either as a row OR as a column. 
            </p>
            <p>
                display:flex on element, becomes flex container, and direct children become flex items. Defaults on flex container are 
                flex-direction:row and align-items:stretch. Can apply properties to flex items as well.
            </p>
            <p>
                Grid Layout is designed to make it easy to lay things out in two dimensions, lining things up in rows AND columns.
            </p>
            <p>
                display:grid on element, with grid-template-columns and grid-template-rows properties to set sizes of columns/rows. No rules for 
                child elements needed, automatically placed. Once you have a grid, you can explicitly place items, rather than relying on 
                auto-placement. To set start and end line of each child, use grid-column and grid-row properties. This causes the items to span 
                multiple tracks.
            </p>
            <p>
                Float properties moves element to left or right and removed from normal flow, and surrounding content FLOATS around it. Four 
                possible properties: left, right, none, and inherit.
            </p>
            <p>
                Positioning techniques (some relying on position property) to move an element from where it would otherwise be placed in normal flow over 
                to another location. Five types of positioning: 
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>static positioning (default, from normal flow)</li>
                <li>relative positioning</li>
                <li>absolute positioning</li>
                <li>fixed positioning</li>
                <li>sticky positioning</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                For relative positioning, position:relative and top/bottom/left/right properties. Element being pushed on it's given properties. 
            </p>
            <p>
                For absolute positioning, position:absolute and top/bottom/left/right properties. Element...
