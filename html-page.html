        <h1>on HTML Basics, Intermediate, and Advanced</h1>
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            This page goes over all things HTML when building a website, from my own perspective. 
            Not so much a teaching page as a personal reminder on how to do this, IMOW, as a quick 
            reference.
        </p>
        <h2>Before you Start</h2>
        <p>
            Create a folder for your web projects. In the web project, you will have different
            folders for sites on there. In each site folder, you should have: </p>
            <ol>
                <li>a folder for images</li>
                <li>a folder for scripts (JS files go here)</li>
                <li>a folder for styles (CSS files go here)</li>
                <li>an HTML file to access the webpage</li>
            </ol>
        <p>
            You can create HTML, CSS, and JS files through Visual Code Studio. In our first 
            tests, we used "index.html", "style.css" in styles folder, and "main.js" in 
            scripts folder.</p>
        <h2>HTML Structure</h2>
        <p>Every basic HTML file has this structure:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>!DOCTYPE html</li>
                <li>html (set lang here, for better indexing) lang="en-US"</li>
            </ol>
        <p>Inside the HTML element:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>head</li>
                <li>body</li>
            </ol>
        <p>Inside the head element:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>chosen character set</li>
                <li>title (for browser tab)</li>
                <li>link to CSS sheet (link rel="stylesheet" href="cssfile.css")</li>
                <li>link to JS file (script src="jsfile.js" defer)</li>
                <li>link to font set</li>
                <li>keywords, page desc, etc</li>
                <li>favicon (icons but for HTML)</li>
                <li>other metadata</li>
            </ul>
        <p>Inside the body element:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>all content seen by web user (that's you!)</li>
            </ul>
        <h2>Head Element</h2>
        <p>
            On the head: The h1 element should be used only once, to mark up the title of your page
            content, like the story title or news headliner, etc. Lots of meta elements, so only
            going over a few for now.
        </p>
        <p>Meta name content elements can be used for:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>the author of the page (to contact author)</li>
                <li>the description of the page (keywords for SEO, search engine desc)</li>
            </ul>
        <p>To create a favicon:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>save img in same directory as site's index page in .ico format
                    (NOTE: you can use other img types, but won't be supported in older browsers)
                </li>
                <li>create link in head: link rel="icon" href="favicon.ico" type="image/x-icon"</li>
            </ol>
        <p>
            Note that they're also used as high res icons for iPad homescreen apps. Fairly advanced
            feature, so don't worry about implementing these for now, just be able to recognize them.</p>
        <h2>Misc HTML</h2>
        <p>Span elements used when you want to apply CSS or JS to content (more later)</p>
        <p>Can create lists within lists.</p>
        <p>
            To emphasize, use em element. To bold, use strong element. Traditionally, i was used for 
            italics in foreign words, taxonomic designation, technical terms, a thought, etc... 
            Traditionally, b was used for bold in key words, product names, lead sentences, etc... 
            Traditionally, u was used for underline in proper name, misspelling, hyperlinks, etc... 
            Try not to use these last three elements outside of these traditional uses.
        </p>
        <h2>Hyperlinks</h2>
        <p>
            A URL (Uniform Resource Locator) is a string of text that defines where something is 
            located on the Web. URLs use paths to find files. Usually in href="file" if in same
            directory or href="directory/file" if in subdirectories or href="../directory/file" if
            in parent directories. To go up one directory, use .. dots.
        </p>
        <p>
            A URL hyperlink can point to HTML files, text files, images, text documents, video and
            audio files, or anything else that lives on the web. To create a link, use a
            href="https://www.google.com/" text. Click on the text, and it takes you where you
            want to go. You can also add title after the href to display text when the mouse hovers
            over the link. 
        </p>
        <p>
            You can link to specific parts of an HTML document (aka document fragment) by:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>assigning an id attribute to element you want to link to (h2 id="abc")</li>
            <li>include id at end of URL preceded by hash symbol (a href="ex.html#abc")</li>
            <li>(can link to another part of current doc by using on its own in href="#abc")</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            The difference between absolute URL and relative URL: absolute links to 
            <strong>absolute</strong>
            location in web (always points to same location, no matter where its used) and 
            relative links to 
            <strong>relative</strong>
            location in web (points in different places depending 
            on actual location of file you refer from). Absolute includes protocol and domain name,
            relative usually just file name or directory and file name.
        </p>
        <p>Best practices when writing links:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>use clear link wording (download FireFox instead of click here)</li>
            <li>don't repeat URL as part of link text (ugly)</li>
            <li>don't say "links" or "links to" in line text (repetitive)</li>
            <li>keep line text as short as possible</li>
            <li>when linking non-HTML resources, leave clear signposts (download report,
                watch video, play game)</li>
            <li>when linking to downloadable, include download attribute to provide default
                save filename</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Email Links</h2>
        <p>
            When writing email links, use href="mailto:email@email.org". To write Share links,
            don't include the email -- it'll send you to the email client with no destination
            address.
        </p>
        <p>
            You can also add subject, cc, and body to the email, but we won't be exploring that
            here.
        </p>
        <h2>Advanced Text Formatting</h2>
        <h2>Description Lists</h2>
        <p>
            Third type of list, besides unordered and ordered list. To mark up a set of items and
            their associated descriptions (definitions, questions, answers, etc). To create,
            dl dt dd dt dd dt dd. dl for description list name, dt for term, dd for definition.
        </p>
        <h2>Quotations</h2>
        <p>
            To create a quote in a block, p blockquote cite="https://www.google.com". 
            To create a quote in an inline, p q cite="https://www.google.com". Not sure 
            what the difference is...
        </p>
        <h2>Citations</h2>
        <p>
            Not used much by browsers. The cite element meant to contain title of resource
            being quoted, but... Skip for now.
        </p>
        <h2>Abbreviations</h2>
        <p>
            To create an abbreviation element, p abbr title="AlphaBetaComma" ABC. 
        </p>
        <h2>Contact Details</h2>
        <p>
            To create an address element, address. Wraps around contact details, whether that
            be just text, a list, or a link to the contact info. It should only be used to 
            provide contact info for the document contained with the nearest article or body 
            element. 
        </p>
        <h2>Superscript and Subscript</h2>
        <p>
            To create superscript, sup. To create subscript, sub.
        </p>
        <h2>Representing Computer Code</h2>
        <p>
            There are many tags to mark up computer code: code (for generic pieces of code),
            pre (for retaining whitespace), var (for specifically marking up variable names),
            kbd (for marking up keyboard (and other) input entered into computer), samp (for
            marking up output of program).
        </p>
        <h2>Times and Dates</h2>
        <p>
            To mark up times and dates, time datetime="2016-01-20". Useful if you want to attach
            a machine-readable time/date. Can include only certain parts, seconds, weeks, etc.
        </p>
        <h2>Document and Website Structure</h2>
        <h2>Basic Sections of a Document</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>header (header element, used across all pages of website)</li>
            <li>navigation bar (nav element)</li>
            <li>main content (main element, within it article, section, and div elements)</li>
            <li>sidebar (aside, often inside main element)</li>
            <li>footer (footer element)</li>
        </ul>
        <p> 
            Main is for content unique to this page. Use only ONE per page, inside body, not
            nested. Article encloses block of related content that makes sense on its own 
            without the rest of the page. Can be broken up into different sections. 
            Section similar, but for one piece of functionality. Can be broken up into different
            articles. Good practice to begin each section with heading. Aside has content that
            isn't directly related to main content but provides additional info indirectly 
            related to it. Header is group of introductory content. If in body, for global webpage,
            if in article or section, for specific article/section. Nav contains main navigation
            functionality of page. No secondary links. Footer is group of end content for page.
            For more, read up on HTML Element References.
        </p>
        <h3>Non-Semantic Wrappers</h3>
        <p>
            Span and div elements should only be used if you can't think of a better semantic text element to 
            wrap your content, or don't want to add any specific meaning. To create, span 
            class="editor-note". INLINE. To create, div class="shopping-cart". BLOCK. BUT 
            WATCH OUT: divs are so convenient that it's easy to use them
            too much. They clutter HTML code, and make it hard to update and maintain documents. Use
            sparingly.
        </p>
        <h3>Line Breaks and Horizontal Rules</h3>
        <p>
            br elements create a line break in a paragraph, and is the only way to force a rigid structure
            in a situation where you want a series of fixed short lines. hr elements create a horizontal
            rule/line in the document that denotes a thematic change in the text.
        </p>
        <h2>Debugging HTML</h2>
        <p>
            In general, two main types of errors: syntax errors and logic errors. Since HTML is a permissive
            language, no syntax errors.
        </p>
        <p>
            Can view markup browser has rendered (opposed to markup in source code) through the browser
            developer tools. How did the browser fix the HTML errors, if any? 
        </p>
        <p>
            To find errors in large, complex HTML doc, best to run page through Markup Validation Service. 
            You can provide web address, HTML file, or HTML code. It's a good idea to fix a few errors at
            a time. 
        </p>
        <article>
            <h2>Multimedia and Embedding</h2>
            <h3>Images in HTML</h3>
            <p>
                To add images on webpage, use img element with src attribute. AKA img src. 
                WARNING: beware of copyright. Only use images you own, that are in the public domain, or
                you have permission to use. Also, never hotlink to images on other servers without permission.
            </p>
            <p>
                Use alt attribute to describe image in case it can't be seen, to still deliver usable experience. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Use width and height attributes to leave space for image (page loads quicker) but preferably
                use image editor (or CSS) to get correct aspect ratio.
            </p>
            <p>
                Use figure and figcaption to add figures and figure captions to images. Figure contains image 
                and figcaption. Looks like this: figure img src alt figcaption. A figure doesn't have to be 
                an image, it can be anything that:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>expresses your meaning in compact, easy-to-grasp way</li>
                <li>could go in several places in page's linear flow (???)</li>
                <li>provides essential info supporting main text</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                e.g. many imgs, code snippet, audio, video, equations, table, etc.
            </p>
            <p>
                Can also use CSS and JavaScript to embed images into webpages, outside of scope atm.
                If image has meaning, use HTML image. If image is decoration only, use CSS background image.
            </p>
            <h3>Video and Audio Content</h3>
            <p>
                A bit of history: early bandwidth only supported text and images, then plugins like Flash
                and Silverlight were used to embed videos (both obsolete now). Then HTML5 specs added video 
                and audio elements, with new JavaScript APIs to control them. 
            </p>
            <p>
                You can either host your own videos and audio, which uses up a ton of bandwidth, or use 
                online video providers (YouTube and the like) and embed them into your webpages (more on 
                this later).
            </p>
            <p>
                Use video element to embed videos. Usually video src controls p. You can use controls attribute or
                appropriate JavaScript API. The p contains fallback content, displayed if browser accessing page
                doesn't support video element.
            </p>
            <p>
                Sometimes video/audio won't play because diff browsers support diff video/audio formats (AKA 
                container formats). These container formats contain media structure, metadata, codecs used, etc.
                Metadata can be title, duration, track types, etc. Tracks can be audio, video, text. Codex compress 
                video/audio into manageable files. Complex, outside of scope atm.
            </p>
            <p>
                Video element features to know about: width, height, autoplay, loop, muted, poster, preload.
            </p>
            <p>
                Audio element supports all same features as video.
            </p>
            <p>
                To create video text tracks, use WebVTT file format and track element. Looks like track kind src 
                label, and is within video element. Outside of scope atm.
            </p>
            <h3>Other Embedding Techs</h3>
            <p>
                A bit of history: framesets containing frames used to create websites, then plugin techs like 
                Java Applets and Flash used to embed rich content (often used object and embed elements), then 
                the iframe element can embed entire web docs inside another, as if it were just another element.
            </p>
            <p>
                In general, iframe good for incorporating 3rd-party content into website (no need to implement 
                your own version). YouTube has iframe element code under Share button that easily embeds given 
                video to website. e.g. video, commenting systems, maps, ads, etc.
            </p>
            <p>
                To create, iframe src width height. Best to use style iframe border:none under head element to
                display w/o borders. Can also add fallback content.
            </p>
            <p>
                Since there are security concerns with regards to iframes, best practices are: only embed when 
                necessary, use https (GitHub pages does this by default), always use sandbox attribute, configure
                CSP directives. Outside of scope atm.  
            </p>
            <p>
                The embed and object elements aren't used very much anymore, mostly in intranets and enterprise
                projects. As for plugins: just use browser Web techs instead. Everyone has a browser, but not 
                everyone has a plugin. More secure/convenient to use Web techs. 
            </p>
            <h3>Vector Graphics</h3>
            <p>
                Two types of images on the web: raster images and vector images. Raster images defined using a grid
                of pixels (e.g. bmp, png, jpeg, gif). Vector images defined using algorithms (e.g. SVG format). 
            </p>
            <p>
                The difference is that vector images remain crisp and clear as you zoom in -- pixel size doesn't change, 
                but the algorithm adjusts.
            </p>
            <p>
                SVG is an XML-based language for describing vector images. Like HTML, but for marking up graphics, 
                not content. Very difficult to handcode complex images, so best to use vector graphics editor like 
                Inkscape or Illustrator. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Use raster over SVG if processing time is important, want simpler, less time consuming images, or 
                want support in older browsers. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Suffice to say, either embed in img element, or in svg element. Outside of scope, just be able to 
                recognize.

            <h3>Responsive Images</h3>
            <p>
                These are images that work well on devices with widely different screen sizes, resolutions, and other
                features. When considering this, often come across the art direction problem, where you want to serve
                diff cropped images in that way, for various layouts. 
            </p>
            <p>
                When considering smaller or larger images, you come across the resolution switching problem, where 
                you consider whether to use small or large image. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Vector images help, and you should use them wherever possible, but they're only really great for simple
                graphics, patterns, interface elements, etc. Not for photo-detail level images.
            </p>
            <p>
                One way to solve the resolution switching problem is to use the srcset and sizes attributes in img element 
                to add more source images, with hints to help browsers pick the right one. 
            </p>
            <p>
                To create a srcset attribute, img srcset="file.jpg 100w". The 100w uses the image's real width, found
                by inspecting the image file. Separate multiple imgs within srcset with a comma. Following srcset, to 
                create a sizes attribute, sizes="(mediaCondition) 400px, 800px". The mediaCondition is outside of scope,
                just know that it describes a possible state the screen can be in. The 400px is the width of the slot 
                the image will fill when mediaCondition is true.
            </p>
            <p>
                The browser will look at its device width, look for which media condition in sizes is the first to be 
                true, looks at the slot size given, then load the image referenced in srcset that has the same size or
                the first image that is bigger than the chosen slot size. This method can save a lot of bandwidth.
            </p>
            <p>
                Another way to solve the resolution switching problem is to allow the browser to choose an appropriate 
                resolution image by using srcset with x-descriptors and w/o sizes. 
            </p>
            <p>
                To create these types, img srcset="file.jpg, file.jpg 1.5x, file.jpg 2x" src alt. The browser will choose
                which image works best with the display it's on.
            </p>
            <p>
                One way to solve the art direction problem is to use the picture element to show a more appropriate
                portrait image.
